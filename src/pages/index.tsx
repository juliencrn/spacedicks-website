            The CryptoDicks are a collection of 10,000 uniquely generated dicks as high quality SVG images. 
            No two are exactly alike, and each one of them can be officially owned by a single person on the Polygon blockchain.
            Until all are mined, everyone can mint its one.

          <p>
            When a new CryptoDicks token is minted, its unique traits are generated randomly and saved on the blockchain by the smart-contract.
            At the end of this on-chain process, an URL is generated.
          </p>
          <p>
            Every applications that want to show the DICK image (like NFT Marketplaces, wallets) will call this URL.
            At the first call, the SVG image is created following the traits given by the on-chain metadata, and uploaded on a decentralized peer-to-peer network, the Inter-Planetary File System (IPFS). 
            This way, the DICK metadata and image are both frozen forever on decentralized networks.
